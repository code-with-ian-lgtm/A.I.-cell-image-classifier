Malaria Cell Classifier using Artificial Intelligence
This project utilizes artificial intelligence to classify malaria-infected cells as paralyzed or unparalized.

Overview
This Python project aims to identify and classify malaria-infected cells into two categories: paralyzed and unparalized. The classification is performed using AI techniques, specifically leveraging machine learning models trained on a dataset of labeled cell images.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Preprocesses cell images to enhance features relevant for classification.
Model Training: Trains machine learning models (e.g., CNNs) on labeled datasets to classify cells.
Inference: Provides a mechanism to classify new cell images as paralyzed or unparalized using trained models.
Visualization: Displays visual results of classification for easy interpretation.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose one based on your implementation)
OpenCV for image processing
Jupyter Notebook for development and testing
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/malaria-cell-classifier.git
cd malaria-cell-classifier
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset of malaria-infected cell images.
Training: Train the AI model using your dataset. Modify the model architecture in train.py if necessary.
Inference: Use the trained model to classify new images. Implement inference scripts in inference.py.
Visualization: Visualize classification results for evaluation and presentation.
